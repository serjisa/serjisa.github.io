Hi there! I'm Sergey (*Серёжа* in Russian), and I'm currently a PhD student in the [Adameyko group](https://adameykolab.eu) at the Medical University of Vienna. My main passion lies in single-cell genomics and the statistical methods used for its analysis.

At the moment, I'm working under the guidance of [Igor Adameyko](https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/hp/phd-neuroscience/research-laboratories/igor-adameyko/) and [Peter Kharchenko](https://altoslabs.com/team/principal-investigators-san-diego/peter-kharchenko/), focusing on developing approaches for the analysis and interpretation of multimodal single-cell omics and lineage barcoding experiments. Beyond that, I as far as possible contribute to the single-cell analysis community (e. g. [Symphonypy](https://github.com/potulabe/symphonypy) package, a port of Symphony for the scverse ecosystem, was created under my supervision).

During my free time, I indulge in watching contemporary films, attending techno raves, and delving into the world of music production. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you'd like to connect or have any questions.
